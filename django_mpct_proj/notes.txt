models.py, views.py-->MaterialDetailViewFunc:
    After I created a model Certificate, an object Certificate has appeared in the Materials model. 
    But this object is not a field. It could be because the Certificate model has a Foreign Field "Materials".
    You need to check, if it is so. When You create A foreign key in one model, you have the object in another model the Foreign key is referring to. 
    I solved this issue by skipping this object in MaterialDetailViewFunc.

You can create a form for the `Certificate` model and customize it to show only the fields you want. Here's a general approach:

1. Define your form class that inherits from `ModelForm`.
2. In the `Meta` class of your form, specify the `Certificate` model.
3. In the `fields` attribute of the `Meta` class, list only the fields you want to include in the form.

Here's an example:

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Certificate

class CertificateForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Certificate
        fields = ['field1', 'field2', 'field3']  # replace with your field names
```

In this example, `field1`, `field2`, and `field3` should be replaced with the names of the fields you want to include in the form.

To include only those fields from the inherited models which in `Materials` table are not null, you would need to add some logic to check the `Materials` table and dynamically adjust the `fields` list. This could be done in the `__init__` method of your form class.

Here's a rough example:

```python
class CertificateForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        material = self.instance.material  # assuming 'material' is the FK to Material
        if material.field4 is not None:  # replace 'field4' with your field name
            self.fields['field4'] = forms.CharField()  # or whatever type of field it is

    class Meta:
        model = Certificate
        fields = ['field1', 'field2', 'field3']  # initial list of fields
```

In this example, `field4` is a field from an inherited model. If `field4` is not null in the related `Material` instance, it gets added to the form‚Å¥.

Please replace `'field1'`, `'field2'`, `'field3'`, and `'field4'` with your actual field names. Also, replace `forms.CharField()` with the appropriate form field class based on the type of your field.

Remember, this is a general approach. Depending on your specific requirements and database schema, you might need to adjust this code. If you encounter any issues, please provide more specific details about your models and I'll do my best to help.

Yes, you can definitely loop through them. Here's an example of how you might do it:

```python
class CertificateForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        material = self.instance.material  # assuming 'material' is the FK to Material

        # List of fields from the inherited models
        inherited_fields = ['field4', 'field5', 'field6']  # replace with your field names

        for field in inherited_fields:
            if getattr(material, field) is not None:
                self.fields[field] = forms.CharField()  # or whatever type of field it is

    class Meta:
        model = Certificate
        fields = ['field1', 'field2', 'field3']  # initial list of fields
```

In this example, `inherited_fields` is a list of the fields from the inherited models. The `for` loop goes through each field in this list. If the field is not null in the related `Material` instance, it gets added to the form.

Please replace `'field1'`, `'field2'`, `'field3'`, `'field4'`, `'field5'`, and `'field6'` with your actual field names. Also, replace `forms.CharField()` with the appropriate form field class based on the type of your field.

Remember, this is a general approach. Depending on your specific requirements and database schema, you might need to adjust this code. If you encounter any issues, please provide more specific details about your models and I'll do my best to help.
